# _Airspace_ for Jekyll
![screenshot](/assets/img/screenshots/home.png "Landing")

This Jekyll theme is a rebuild of [Andrew Lee's](https://github.com/ndrewtl/airspace-jekyll) port of ThemeFisher's Airspace template. It is released under ThemeFisher's free license, which requires attribution.

Most everything has been updated, but this is very much still a work-in-progress rebuild, particularly for the JavaScript/jQuery.
