# Airspace Jekyll
![Airspace](https://demo.themefisher.com/thumbnails/airspace.png "Landing")

This Jekyll theme is a rebuild of ThemeFisher's free [Airspace Jekyll theme](https://github.com/themefisher/airspace-jekyll), originally ported by [@ndrewtl](https://github.com/ndrewtl). 
It is released under the MIT license, which requires preversation of copyright and license notices.

Most everything has been updated, but this is very much still a work-in-progress rebuild, particularly for the JavaScript/jQuery.

## Setup

To start your project, [fork this respository](https://github.com/TankedThomas/airspace-jekyll/fork).
After forking the repo, your site will be live immediately on your personal Github Pages account, e.g. `https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo-name/`.

Make sure GitHub Pages is enabled for your repo. It might take some time for the site to propagate entirely.

## Customize

Things you can customize in `_data/settings.yml` (no HTML/CSS):

- Theme General Settings ( name, logo, email, phone, address )
- Hero Section
- About Section
- Team Section
- Skills Section
- Experience Section
- Education Section
- Services Section
- Portfolio Section
- Testimonials Section
- Client Slider Section
- Contact Section

## Deployment

To run the theme locally, navigate to the theme directory and run `bundle install` to install the dependencies, then run `jekyll serve` or `bundle exec jekyll serve` to start the Jekyll server.
I would recommend checking the [Deployment Methods](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/deployment-methods/) page on Jekyll's website.
